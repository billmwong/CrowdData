### Language

We will use approachable language that is encouraging and welcoming for the user.
The app will come off as friendly and maybe a little excited, making sure to convey
information, but being careful to not overwhelm the user.

Requests will be in the form of questions, making sure to request information of the user,
never demanding it.

Tips will be presented as things to consider, avoiding "telling" the user what to do or
think as they form their survey.
